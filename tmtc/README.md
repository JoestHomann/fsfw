### How to use this folder

This folder contains template files to set up the TMTC commander 
for a new mission or project. These files are the adaption
point to customize the TMTC commander.

To do so, simply copy all folder inside the TMTC commander root. This
step is also required because the TMTC commander core will load some modules.
